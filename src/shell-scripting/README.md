# Shell Scripting/Interactive Requirements

A terminal emulator (like [kitty](../terminals/kitty.md)) is pretty-much useless
without a proper "[Shell](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)>)".
Hence, every developer out there who're familiar with a CLI environment know
what [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash) or [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org) is.

I prefer using the [Fish](https://fishshell.com) for a couple of reasons & some
of the reasons include:

1. Syntax highlighting
2. Out-of-the-box auto-completion (which is pretty powerful)
3. Easier configurations

_... and so on!_

I've listed my reasoning for choosing the Fish Shell in more detail in later
sub-section, so do check it out.

For those who're interested in learning more about, the section of the book
details the various shells I use, why & how. And following are the shells I use
on a day-to-day basis:

- [Bash](bash.md)
- [Fish](fish.md)

That said, head on to the next chapters to find out more about the shells I use
everyday!
