# Introducing the Workstations Used for Software Development

I utilise a wide range of workstations for my software development needs. Each
of those workstations are running either a single Operating System(OS) or in
[dual-boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting) format. This section of
the book, sheds more light on the specific details of the workstations I use.

You can expect to find the following details in the succeeding chapters:

1. Why/how I use Windows-based machines for software development.

2. The specific set of tools used on all the workstations & how do they perform.

3. Certain caveats & heads-up to know before setting up a cross-platform
   development environment for yourself.

...and much more! Do check out the individual chapters to learn more about my
cross-platform development experience!
