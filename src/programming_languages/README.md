# Programming Languages

There was a brief mention of the programming I use at my disposal on -
[List of Software I Use](../tools_used#programming-languages--their-respective-frameworks).
So this section attempts a more in-depth discussion of how & why I use a variety
of programming languages.

And to reiterate, following are the programming languages I use on a day-to-day
basis. The frameworks (and other related tools I use) are also included in the
following section;

- [Python](https://python.org)
  - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) (and
  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org))
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash)
- [Golang](https://go.dev)
- [Lua](https://www.lua.org)

The next few chapters will go into more specific details on how I use those
programming languages. I'll also attempt to justify why that specific tech stack
has been used & not something else.
