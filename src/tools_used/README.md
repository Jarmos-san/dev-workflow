# Tools I Use on a Daily Basis

Software development tasks are difficult to perform without use of certain tools
like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) & so on. As such I use a variety
of tools for my daily requirements. And this section of the book discusses &
attempts to share brief descriptions of how I use those tools.

## Core Miscellaneous Tools I Absolutely Need

Following are some tools I can't live without no matter what & will need them
regardless of where which platform I chose to develop code on:

- [Chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io) (for managing my dotfiles)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (the text editor which can
  be transformed into an IDE with the help of plugins)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) (the sensible fork of the
  [Vim](https://www.vim.org))
- [Kitty Terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty) (a fast, GPU-accelerated
  terminal emulator)
- [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) (yet another GPU-accelerated
  terminal emulator for Windows 10/11)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) & [GitHub](https://github.com) (to version-control
  all my software & backing them up on to a remote server)
- [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org) for screen capture requirements.
- And [GitHub](https://github.com/Jarmos-san) for backing up my source code as
  well as to version-control them on a remote server.

## Programming Languages & Their Respective Frameworks

Of course, no software can be developed without using a programming & a
companion framework. So, following are the languages & their respective
frameworks I use on a daily basis:

- [Python](https://www.python.org)
  - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) for building & creating super-fast
    REST APIs.
  - I frequently use the tool also build quick scripts as well every now & then.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for building frontend projects like websites &
    what not.
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash) for building scripts where Python
  mightn't be the right choice.
- [Golang](https://go.dev) for building cross-platform projects like CLI tools &
  such.
- [Lua](https://www.lua.org) for configuring Neovim (and perhaps developing a
  couple of Neovim plugins here & there).

## CLI Tools for Increased Productivity

If you've known me long enough you would know, I absolutely adore the CLI
environment! Its a major productivity booster for me & I like it even more
mainly because of the minimalistic environment. That said, following are a
couple of tools I use to boost my productivity;

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for installing the following CLI tools mentioned
  below. I use `brew` instead of `apt` because Ubuntu packages are often
  outdated.
- [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) for pretty-printing JSON output on the
  CLI environment.
- [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook) for writing the online &
  freely-available versions of my books.
- [`gh`](https://cli.github.com) for managing GitHub from the CLI environment
  but I'm yet to find an excuse to use it yet!
- [`glow`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) preview Markdown files from
  within my CLI environment which is also required by a Neovim plugin I
  frequently use!
- [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) (and its list of "plugins") a better
  `cat` replacement with syntax highlighting & much more!
- [`chezmoi`](https://chezmoi.io) for managing my dotfiles.
- [`gcc`](https://gcc.gnu.org) required by Neovim to compiles the Treesitter
  parsers.
- [`exa`](https://the.exa.website), a better `ls` & `tree` utility which is also
  written in Rust ❤️.
- [`fish`](https://fishshell.com), a better Shell environment with support for
  awesome completions & syntax highlighting!
- [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org), a packaging & project management tool
  for Python.
- [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com), a CLI tool for creating
  [`githooks`](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks).
- [`stylua`](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua), an opinionated formatter
  for Lua files.
- [`prettier`](https://prettier.io), another opinionated formatter for quite a
  lot of files like Markdown, TypeScript/JavaScript, YAML, JSON & so on.
- [`unzip`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/unzip), a necessary tool for the rare
  times when extracting the contents of a `.zip` file is necessary.
