# About My Personal Development Machines

I use a myriad of machines ranging from Linux/Windows PCs to Raspberry Pi (RPi)
devices & laptops! Keeping a track of changes, requirements & configurations
across all those devices is painful (and extremely time-consuming). Hence, I
decided to document everything related to all the devices I use for my
development needs in this section.

To give you a slight overview of what next few chapters are all about, here are
some pointers:

- Why & how I prefer an Unix-like development environment.
- How do I manage [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://aka.ms/wsl) on my
  Windows machines.
- Development on a tiny RPi, is that even possible?
- And usage details of my remote servers (if I plan to maintain any in the near
  future).

That said, dive into the next couple of chapters to read more about how I use different types of machines for my development needs.
