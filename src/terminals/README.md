# Terminal Emulators Preferences

No developer toolkit out in the wild is complete without a preferred ["_Terminal
Emulator_"][1] & suffice to say my toolkit is no different either. This section
of the book (_and the ensuing chapters_) takes a deeper dive into how I use &
configure my preferred Terminal Emulators. Do note, I use the word "_Terminal_"
to synonymously denote "_Terminal Emulators_".

That said, following are the two Terminals I use often (_and for the foreseeable
future until I stumble across something better_):

1. [Kitty Terminal][2], the (**_supposedly_**) cross-platform terminal for
   Unix-based OSes. For now I use it across all my Linux machines since it
   doesn't support Windows (_and I doubt it ever will, [see the original
   author's comment][3]_).

2. [Windows Terminal][4], is the recommended terminal of choice for Windows
   machines & I use it on the machines with Windows OS installed. Its not as
   featured as Kitty (_and I like its minimalism_) but unfortunately it doesn't
   work on Unix-based devices.

As you can see, for now I use two different Terminals! In an ideal world I would
prefer to stick to either one. But differences in opinion & lack of support
means I've to keep using two different tools for the same task. ðŸ¤¦

Regardless of what the developers think, I did manage (_to whatever extent
possible_) to standardize my development workflow. And following is list of
sub-topics you'll stumble upon in the succeeding chapters.

1. Introducing each of the terminals & the specific use case(s) they serve me
   for.

2. About configurations options like - "_setting up custom keybindings_",
   "_using an uniform & standardized theme_". And how you can configure them for
   yourself as well.

3. Specific issues and/or quirks I faced while using any of the aforementioned
   tools.
