# Preface of the Project

## What to Expect in the Book

This book documents my personal software development workflow. The said workflow
as stated in this site has been developed over years of trial & error. The book
intends to not only document those changes & updates but serve as a source of
inspiration. So, if you're a professional developer or someone who's been
training to become one, this resource might be of beneit to you.

On that note, following are some stuff you can expect to find/learn in the rest
of the website:

1. Leveraging Docker's versatality by using it from production to development
   environments & other niche areas of applications.

2. Setting up `git` & other related tools across multiple machines without much
   hassle.

3. Configuring various development tools like [Neovim](https://neovim.io) &
   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) across many different
   machines (and Operating Systems) to behave pretty much the same.

...the website contains more of the intricate details so do check it out!

Do note, the website is ever-changing & as the technology I use on a day-to-day
basis changes, so will this website!

## How is the Book Structured

This website is structured is a book-format (thanks to the
[`mdBook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/) project). The project allows to
use the best of both worlds (a written book & a website) for easier readability.
So, if you ever want to author a book (or even a documentation) do check out the
project!

On that note, this "_website_" will be addressed synonymously with the word
"_book_" from here on.

That said, the book has been divided into four distinct sections:

1. **Workstation Platforms** - Contains a bunch of write-ups related to the
   various Operating Systems (OSes) & platforms I use for my development needs.

2. **Development Toolbox** - Contains all the details of the various tools I
   use, ranging from a `git` to Visual Studio Code! This section of the book is
   probably the most important part of the book after the Fourth section!

3. **Technical Writing Needs** - Details my requirements (and experience) of
   using various tools/platforms for my
   [Technical Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_writing) needs.
   if you're wondering, yes, besides software development I'm also a Technical
   Writer.

4. **Miscellaneious Guides** - Contains various "_how-to_" guides related to
   software development! You can expect to find resources which I shared based
   on my experience as a Software Developer over the years.

In addition to the four sections of the book, check the following sections for
more information:

1. The ["**Appendix**"](appendix.html) for links to other resources which could
   prove useful.

2. If you want to contribute to the book itself, then be sure to check out the
   ["**Usage Terms & Conditions**"](terms-and-conditions.html) of the book
   before sending a Pull Request.

3. Want to know more about the author? Then check out the
   ["**About the Author**"](about-jarmos.html) section of the book.

And on that note, I hope you find the contents of the book informative! If
you've some feedback to provide or perhaps share a better workflow, please don't
hesitate to do so. You can find details on how to reach me in the
["**About the Author**"](about-jarmos.html) page.
