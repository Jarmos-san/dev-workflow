# List of Tools I Use for Software Development

A craftsperson is nothing without his/her tools, so is a Software Developer!
Suffice to say, simply owning a [workstation](../workstations/index.html) isn't
enough. The workstation needs to be well-equipped with the tools of the crafts
as well. And as such this section of the book sheds light on the specific
details of all the tools I use across all my workstations.

To get a brief idea of what sort of tools I use on a day-to-day basis, here's a
brief list:

1. [`chezmoi`](https://chezmoi.io) for managing my dotfiles & "decentralizing"
   them to be usable across multiple platforms & OSes.

2. Various [Text Editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) like
   [Neovim](https://neovim.io) &
   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for writing & scripting
   software.

3. Different
   [Terminal Emulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) used
   across Linux & Windows-based workstations.

4. A myriad range of
   [Command-line Interface(CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
   tools for tasks like formatting, version-control & such.

...and much more! The aforementioned list is only a sneak-peak into all the
tools I utilise for my every-day software development needs. And you'll find
more specific details on usage guidance & their caveats in the individual
chapters.
